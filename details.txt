There is a large dining room inside the hall and all the students of the hall take their lunch and supper smoothly in this dining room. There are forty one (41) residential rooms, one guest room, and a library cum study room in this hall. There are 1857 books in the hall library and some of those books are written by foreign writers. The study room is kept open till 11:30 pm on weekdays and general students can study without any disturbance. Also a common room of this hall is providing the facilities for watching television and playing indoor games.

There is a strong "Hall Committee" with dedicated students to manage the various activities of the hall voluntarily. The administrative works of the hall are carried out by a Provost and two Assistant Provosts appointed by the authority of KUET. A caretaker cum hall assistant works for the sake of student affairs and maintains the accounts of the hall. There are a beautiful garden and large playground inside the hall territory. We hope that Lalan Shah Hall will help to make a great nation.
